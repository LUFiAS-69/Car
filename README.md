## Version

Unity 21.3.12f1 (LTS)
## Documentation

The car is moved using transform.Translate method. It has no rigidbody and gravity is not applied to it.

You can modify the values of the car engine from the inspector to behave like a sports car or off-road car. You can also control the traction or drift amount of the car.

Will add sounds if I get the time xD

## Controls

The car is controlled using simple and kid-friendly controls:

**W / Up Arrow:** Move forward.\
**S / Down Arrow:** Move backward.\
**A / Left Arrow:** Turn left.\
**D / Right Arrow:** Turn right.
